Trusting SSL certificates

I wrote this shell script to download server cert from <server_address> & give user specific <cert_name> to cert. After downloading it'll start generating the keystore for which user need to give <keystore_password>. After creating keystore, it'll verify keystore using same <keystore_password>, which user need to enter for verification.

To make use of this script, first you need to set JAVA_HOME & CLASSPATH for BouncyCastle. For example:-

export JAVA_HOME="/opt/java/jdk1.8.0_20"
export CLASSPATH="/home/ashish/Library/BouncyCastle"
